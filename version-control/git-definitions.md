# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

** What is version control?  Why is it useful?**
*Version control is a set of systems and processes that allows users to create and manage multiple versions of software. Version control is useful because it allows for developers, designers and other involved parties to create software individually while maintaining a consistent code base. 
**What is a branch and why would you use one?**
*A branch is a version of a respective code base. Branches are used by developers to maintain the original code base, while making edits on their own branch that can be committed to the master code base.
**What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
*A commit is a change to a branch which can be either an edit or a new file. A good commit message would include what work has been done in the file to be committed along with the file name.
**What is a merge conflict?**
*A merge conflict is when you have commits in your current branch that are not in the other branch*
